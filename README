Hacker News Droid App Source Code

HN geeks everywhere! This is my gift to you. I spent close to a month building the app and the API (http://hndroidapi.appspot.com) and spend at least a few hours a week doing maintenance and feature enhancements.

Hopefully, you can learn something from my code. The app was inspired by Google's IO 2011 app and contains some of the source from the IO app.

Anyways, lets make this a great app so we can all enjoy Hacker News Droid even more. 

You can download the app here: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.glebpopov.hackernews
